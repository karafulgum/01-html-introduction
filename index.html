      <hr class="divider">

      <p>It's only been one day at the Iron Yard, but I've already learned so much. I was a little nervous going into class because I didn't know what to expect, but the pre-work really helped to prepare me. The day really flew by and I felt like I had a
        good grasp on everything.</p>
      <p>When it came time to the assignment I had a little more trouble. I really had to slow down to make sure I wasn't missing anything and was adding the correct syntax. I realized that if I was stuck on something taking a quick break would really help
        and I could come back a few minutes later. It was great seeing the progress I made in just a few hours.</p>

      <hr class="divider">

      <p>De-bugging was really tough for me. Little things like missing semi-colons really tripped me up. I feel like those will be the things I really need to pay attention to. </p>
      <p>I see a lot of similar code to pre-work, but then again there's a ton of code I don't recognize. I'm excited to learn it all and one day be able to code something like this by myself.</p>

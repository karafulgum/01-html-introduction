    <hr class="divider">

    <p>It's only been one day at the Iron Yard, but I've already learned so much. I was a little nervous going into class because I didn't know what to expect, but the pre-work really helped to prepare me. The day really flew by and I felt like I had a good grasp on everything.</p>
    <p>When it came time to the assignment I had a little more trouble. I really had to slow down to make sure I wasn't missing anything and was adding the correct syntax. I realized that if I was stuck on something taking a quick break would really help and I could come back a few minutes later. It was great seeing the progress I made in just a few hours.</p>
